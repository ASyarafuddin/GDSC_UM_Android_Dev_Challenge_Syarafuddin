1. Should I ask user for name (to make it more personalized e.g. Hello 'user's name' when they login)
- i think not necessary, because for me the nature of writing diary is in anonymous and being secret
- i'll go for calling 'User'

2. i think something not right about the UI/UX to display the diaries
- not suitable if got lengthy text

3. adding Date for every entry
- TextView
- save Date info in firebase
- display Date in DiaryAdapter
